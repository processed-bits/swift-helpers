	/// Creates a new set from a string.
	///
	/// - Parameters:
	///   - string: The string to split.
	///   - separator: The element that should be split upon.
	///   - maxSplits: The maximum number of times to split the collection, or one less than the number of subsequences to return. If `maxSplits + 1` subsequences are returned, the last one is a suffix of the original collection containing the remaining elements. `maxSplits` must be greater than or equal to zero. The default value is `Int.max`.
	///   - omittingEmptySubsequences: If `false`, an empty subsequence is returned in the result for each consecutive pair of `separator` elements in the collection and for each instance of `separator` at the start or end of the collection. If `true`, only nonempty subsequences are returned. The default value is `true`.
	///   - trimCharacters: Character set  to use for removing characters from both ends of the `String`. The default value is `.whitespaces`.
